# jsCav - a linear cavity calculator

jsCav is a simple calculator for linear optical cavities written in javascript,
which allows it to run in any modern web browser (also on mobile devices!).
Here's what it looks like and what it can calculate for you:

To run, simply copy all files to one directory, then open the `index.html` in
your favourite web browser (needs to be some recent version of
Chrome/Safari/Opera/Firefox/...).

It is of course possible to host this on a webserver, for easy access. Since it
runs in the user's web browser, there are absolutely no dependencies.
